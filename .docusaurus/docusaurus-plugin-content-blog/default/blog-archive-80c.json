This is why we migrated to Docusaurus.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\nThe documentation will soon be merged into the master branch of Homarr.\nYou'll find a ``doc/`` directory in the root of Homarr.\nWe'll obviously not include this in our Docker images.\nIn the future, everyone may modify the documentation by creating a pull request.\nAfter we've reviewed your changes, we'll merge your PR and this documentation will automatically update.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe documentation on GitHub Wiki will soon disappear. It will be replaced with this Docusaurus-powered website. You'll find much more information here with higher detail and searchability."
